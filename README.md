# Visnai Project

This is a static website project.

## How to Run

Since this is a simple HTML/CSS/JS project, you can run it using any simple HTTP server.

### Using Python (Recommended)
If you have Python 3 installed:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Using Node.js
If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx`:

```bash
npx serve
```

### Directly
You can also simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser, though some features might work better when served over HTTP.
